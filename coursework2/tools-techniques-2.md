This is my KanBan board. Task are devided based on the MoSCow Technique. The task marked by M are the must have, which is the core requirement in the specification. Marked by S are the should haves, they complement the core requirement but do not require extensive research. THe 2 task in to do are additional task that requires additional research, at the time this screenshot is taken it was not done.

## Source Code Control and CI
https://github.com/ucl-comp0035/comp0035-cw-i-JocelynS371.git
here is the link to my github, where you can see the version history and action. It was not updated regularly in the first few week because it was inconvinent to upload pdfs onto github, when I was working on the requirements and design.

## Linting
I used Flake8 to lint my code, before linting, the code looked like this

After linting, it looks like this

There are 3 warning ignored, they stemed from the assert statement where a boolean value was compared directly. I choose to ignore this warning because this is a case where the comparision make sense.
